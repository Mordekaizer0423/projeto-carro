                <br>The Mercedes-AMG GT3 Evo was introduced to iRacing as part of the 2022 Season 3 update, expanding the platformâ€™s GT3 lineup to a total of nine cars.
                <br>
                <br>This vehicle features a naturally aspirated 6.2-liter V8 engine producing 550 horsepower, positioned in front of the cockpit. This front-engine setup results in a lighter rear, requiring careful handling and balance management. 
                <br>
                <br>Like the other cars in the GT3 classâ€”against which it competes under Balance of Performance regulationsâ€”the Mercedes-AMG GT3 Evo is rear-wheel drive. It is equipped with a 6-speed sequential gearbox, as well as traction control and ABS systems.
                <br>
                <br>The car is not available for rookie races; drivers must first attain at least a D or C license to be eligible to race it.
